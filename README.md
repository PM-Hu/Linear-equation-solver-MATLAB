# Aha
This repository is intended to store some classic algorithms to solve linear equations of the form:
$$
\mathbf{A}x = b
$$
The updating is in progress but may not frequently, may the force be with me.

# Algorithms

- Gauss Seidel

- Gauss Seidel mex version, but inefficient

  some descriptions here ....
